         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ON Sunday morning laÅ¿t, a party of the Marq. of Ormonds
horÅ¿e faced our frontier Guards, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping a great careering neer the City
Walls, and making Å¿everall bold attempts within PiÅ¿tol Å¿hot of our Line,
Spurs, and Sconces, which continued for the Å¿pace of half an hour; till at
the laÅ¿t Capt. <hi>Cambray</hi> (Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief of the new Fort) made a
Å¿alley out with a party of horÅ¿e and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>oor, who placed the MuÅ¿quetiers in
an obÅ¿cure trench, for an AmbuÅ¿cado; he himÅ¿elf being the Coy, for the
calling in and enÅ¿naring of the adverÅ¿e party; but upon his firÅ¿t advance
towards them with his horÅ¿e, he found it a Work very full of difficulty, by
reaÅ¿on that they had uÅ¿ed the like point of policp: However, he reÅ¿olved
to diÅ¿pute the place, and thereupon divided his horÅ¿e (being 60 in number)
into two parties, he himÅ¿elf commanding the one, and Corner lack for the
other; Capt. <hi>Cambray</hi> charged <pb n="2" facs="tcp:117550:3"/>

the Van of the Enemies Forlorn, Cornet <hi>JackÅ¿on</hi> flanke
them, and upon their firÅ¿t charge exchanged ground, with the loÅ¿Å¿e of
three men on both Å¿ides; but upon their preÅ¿ent wheeling, both parties
received each other with a Å¿econd deÅ¿perate OnÅ¿et, who with great courage
&amp; reÅ¿olution kept their Å¿tations, diÅ¿puting the place with great
gallantry; but at laÅ¿t our men being overpowred (by the coming on of a
freÅ¿h Å¿upply of horÅ¿e) were forced to embrace an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable retreat; the
enemy purÅ¿ued to the very turn pikes, where they were Å¿oon welcomed by the
Å¿ons of <hi>Mars,</hi> both from the mouth of the Canon and MuÅ¿quer, at
which Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, 7 of them were forced to yeeld obedience, and one man having his
head Å¿eparated from his Å¿houlders by a Drake Å¿hot, his right hand man
being Å¿omewhat Å¿tartled thereat, immediatly reply'd, <hi>The Divel's in
theÅ¿e Round-heads for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off heads.</hi> Whereupon the enemy Å¿oon
deÅ¿erted engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, leaving dead and wounded upon the place about 17, of
our party five Å¿lain and two wounded.</p>
            <p>Since the enemies receipt of the intelligence of the Lord
Lieutenant <hi>Cramwels</hi> deÅ¿ignment for this bleeding City, they have
Å¿omewhat awakened us with Å¿tronger all arms, and (as we heat) have entred
into ProteÅ¿tation, <hi>to live and die, stand and fall together, and to
Å¿ight it out to the laÅ¿t man,</hi> and that upon receipt of the foreÅ¿aid
intelligence, <hi>Ormend</hi> called a Councell of Officers, at the head
quarters neer Fingles, the reÅ¿ult was, whether they Å¿hould prepare for a
Å¿torm, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his LordÅ¿hips landing, or whether they Å¿hould begin the
City, Å¿treighten other GariÅ¿ons, take in what they could and then
randezvouz and draw into a Body, and give him battell at his landing: Upon
mature deliberation thereon, it was unanimoÅ¿ly declared by moÅ¿t of that
PopiÅ¿h and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laticall faction. That if he Å¿et footing there they wold
fight him; in the mean time they would uÅ¿e their utmoÅ¿t endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours 
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117550:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 101 -->
for the reducing of thoÅ¿e GarriÅ¿ons which the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament had
in poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion.</p>
            <p>But the thing that our Souldiery are moÅ¿t doubtfull and
dubious of, is, that they fear the enemy will not give them a field upon the
additionall forces landing, but that they wil rather betake themÅ¿elves to the
Bogs and Woods.</p>
            <p>And although we cannot but repreÅ¿ent our Å¿elves in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Å¿ad condition (without timely relief) yet we cannot but exceedingly rejoyce
at the gallantry of faithfull Col. Jones our Governour, under Å¿uch a Å¿tate,
in his RepreÅ¿entation to the Lord Inchiquin; the Å¿um whereof followeth:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> As for that conference by your LordÅ¿hip now
propounded and deÅ¿ired, it cannot be in prudence admitted, eÅ¿pacially in
matters of this conÅ¿equence, and in times when Å¿uch debatings muÅ¿t needs
be dangerous, as being Å¿ubject to whatÅ¿oever conÅ¿tructions and
miÅ¿conÅ¿tructions alÅ¿o. But Å¿o well am I Å¿atisfied in the juÅ¿tice of
my cauÅ¿e (whereupon the Lords bleÅ¿Å¿ing hath dwelt viÅ¿ibly, as I truÅ¿t
it doth) and I am fixed to my juÅ¿t principles, whence by letters and
diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courÅ¿es I am not to be removed; and I wiÅ¿h heartily your LordÅ¿hip
had done Å¿o likewiÅ¿e.</p>
            <p>Your Sword hath been (I confeÅ¿Å¿e) proÅ¿perous, but
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, my Lord, the cauÅ¿e in which you then appeared, the Å¿ame with
this now by us here maintained, againÅ¿t thoÅ¿e bloudy Rebels.</p>
            <p>But now is your LordÅ¿hip with them moÅ¿t unhappily joyned, to
the admiration of thoÅ¿e who formerly knew your LordÅ¿hips profeÅ¿Å¿ions,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>Our Governour is very vigilant, and reÅ¿olved not to
Å¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render upon any conditions. By the next I Å¿hall impart my Å¿elf more

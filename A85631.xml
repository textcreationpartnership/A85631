            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ON Sunday morning laſt, a party of the Marq. of Ormonds
horſe faced our frontier Guards, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping a great careering neer the City
Walls, and making ſeverall bold attempts within Piſtol ſhot of our Line,
Spurs, and Sconces, which continued for the ſpace of half an hour; till at
the laſt Capt. <hi>Cambray</hi> (Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief of the new Fort) made a
ſalley out with a party of horſe and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oor, who placed the Muſquetiers in
an obſcure trench, for an Ambuſcado; he himſelf being the Coy, for the
calling in and enſnaring of the adverſe party; but upon his firſt advance
towards them with his horſe, he found it a Work very full of difficulty, by
reaſon that they had uſed the like point of policp: However, he reſolved
to diſpute the place, and thereupon divided his horſe (being 60 in number)
into two parties, he himſelf commanding the one, and Corner lack for the
other; Capt. <hi>Cambray</hi> charged <pb n="2" facs="tcp:117550:3"/>

the Van of the Enemies Forlorn, Cornet <hi>Jackſon</hi> flanke
them, and upon their firſt charge exchanged ground, with the loſſe of
three men on both ſides; but upon their preſent wheeling, both parties
received each other with a ſecond deſperate Onſet, who with great courage
&amp; reſolution kept their ſtations, diſputing the place with great
gallantry; but at laſt our men being overpowred (by the coming on of a
freſh ſupply of horſe) were forced to embrace an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable retreat; the
enemy purſued to the very turn pikes, where they were ſoon welcomed by the
ſons of <hi>Mars,</hi> both from the mouth of the Canon and Muſquer, at
which Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, 7 of them were forced to yeeld obedience, and one man having his
head ſeparated from his ſhoulders by a Drake ſhot, his right hand man
being ſomewhat ſtartled thereat, immediatly reply'd, <hi>The Divel's in
theſe Round-heads for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off heads.</hi> Whereupon the enemy ſoon
deſerted engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, leaving dead and wounded upon the place about 17, of
our party five ſlain and two wounded.</p>
            <p>Since the enemies receipt of the intelligence of the Lord
Lieutenant <hi>Cramwels</hi> deſignment for this bleeding City, they have
ſomewhat awakened us with ſtronger all arms, and (as we heat) have entred
into Proteſtation, <hi>to live and die, stand and fall together, and to
ſight it out to the laſt man,</hi> and that upon receipt of the foreſaid
intelligence, <hi>Ormend</hi> called a Councell of Officers, at the head
quarters neer Fingles, the reſult was, whether they ſhould prepare for a
ſtorm, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Lordſhips landing, or whether they ſhould begin the
City, ſtreighten other Gariſons, take in what they could and then
randezvouz and draw into a Body, and give him battell at his landing: Upon
mature deliberation thereon, it was unanimoſly declared by moſt of that
Popiſh and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laticall faction. That if he ſet footing there they wold
fight him; in the mean time they would uſe their utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours 
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117550:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 101 -->
for the reducing of thoſe Garriſons which the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament had
in poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>But the thing that our Souldiery are moſt doubtfull and
dubious of, is, that they fear the enemy will not give them a field upon the
additionall forces landing, but that they wil rather betake themſelves to the
Bogs and Woods.</p>
            <p>And although we cannot but repreſent our ſelves in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſad condition (without timely relief) yet we cannot but exceedingly rejoyce
at the gallantry of faithfull Col. Jones our Governour, under ſuch a ſtate,
in his Repreſentation to the Lord Inchiquin; the ſum whereof followeth:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> As for that conference by your Lordſhip now
propounded and deſired, it cannot be in prudence admitted, eſpacially in
matters of this conſequence, and in times when ſuch debatings muſt needs
be dangerous, as being ſubject to whatſoever conſtructions and
miſconſtructions alſo. But ſo well am I ſatisfied in the juſtice of
my cauſe (whereupon the Lords bleſſing hath dwelt viſibly, as I truſt
it doth) and I am fixed to my juſt principles, whence by letters and
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes I am not to be removed; and I wiſh heartily your Lordſhip
had done ſo likewiſe.</p>
            <p>Your Sword hath been (I confeſſe) proſperous, but
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, my Lord, the cauſe in which you then appeared, the ſame with
this now by us here maintained, againſt thoſe bloudy Rebels.</p>
            <p>But now is your Lordſhip with them moſt unhappily joyned, to
the admiration of thoſe who formerly knew your Lordſhips profeſſions,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>Our Governour is very vigilant, and reſolved not to
ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render upon any conditions. By the next I ſhall impart my ſelf more
